# Project03 --  Custom Pixel 
This is an image processor that switches from images to dots and displays on the screen.
## Content --
1. The work scans the pixels of images and gets the color on the images
2. Interaction between dots/images and people, which means that we could switch images in dot form and even change color by pressing something
3. Set a border that dots cannot escape from the screen, they bounce back when they hit the edge of the screen
4. Gathering and dispersing dots can be done by pressing keys
5. People will receive a hint when they start the program
